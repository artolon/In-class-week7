1. Create an account on lucidchart.com and create an ERD diagram for the following scenario:

A grocery store owner would like to store all their data in a database. Some important facts you need to include are

1) The owner has multiple stores
2) The owner has multiple employees and the managers report to him, but all other employees report to store managers
3) The store has a membership program, but not all customers need to be members

Aside from this, use what you know about grocery stores to create a logical data model.
